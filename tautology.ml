(*

  TAUTOLOGY. A brute-force tautology checker for propositional logic.

    20 Feb 26

  This is the tautology checker that was discussed in the last few lectures. It
  also includes code (mostly for printing) that was not discussed.

open Printf ;;  (* Functions that print objects. *)

(* AL. An association list: a list of 2-tuples that associate KEY's with their
   corresponding VALUE's. *)

type ('key, 'value) al = ('key * 'value) list ;;

(* AL GET. Return the value of KEY from the association list PAIRS. Raise the
   exception NO SUCH KEY if KEY is not in PAIRS. *)

           else alGetting otherPairs
  in alGetting pairs ;;

(* AL PUT. Return a new association list that is like PAIRS, but associates KEY
   with VALUE. We assume KEY is not already a key in PAIRS, though AL PUT will
   still work if it is. *)

  (key, value) :: pairs ;;

(* PROPOSITION. An expression in propositional logic. *)

  Or    of proposition * proposition |   (* L ∨ R *)
  Imply of proposition * proposition |   (* L → R *)
  Equiv of proposition * proposition ;;  (* L ↔ R *)

(* EVALUATE. Evaluate a PROPOSITION to an OCaml Boolean, given the bindings of
   its names in PAIRS. Recall that α → β ≡ ¬ α ∨ β, and that α ↔ β ≡ α = β. We
   dispatch to code that evaluates each connective. *)

   with a newline. *)

   with Booleans. End with a newline. Keys are printed without quotes and their
   values are printed as T's and F's. *)

(* We'll now develop some generators that produce all possible sequences of
   FALSE's and TRUE's. Whenever one of them generates a sequence, it calls its
   continuation ETC on that sequence. *)

(* GENERATE BOOLS. Generate all possible lists of Boolean values, of length N.
   We assume N ≥ 0. This isn't used in the tautology checker. *)

FFF
TFF
FTF
TTF
FFT
TFT
FTT
TTT

*)

(* GENERATE PAIRS. We'll modify GENERATE BOOLS slightly so it makes association
   lists. Generate all possible association lists that associate the strings in
   the list NAMES with Boolean values. This isn't used in the tautology checker
   either. *)

c → F b → F a → F 
c → T b → F a → F 
c → F b → T a → F 
c → T b → T a → F 
c → F b → F a → T 
c → T b → F a → T 
c → F b → T a → T 
c → T b → T a → T 

*)

(* GENERATE AND TEST PAIRS. Here we modify GENERATE PAIRS slightly again. Now
   it not only generates association lists, but it tests if each generated list
   makes its continuation ETC return true. All we did is change the function's
   name, and change its ';' to '&&'. This is used in the tautology checker. *)

(* UNIQUIFY. Return a list like THINGS, but in which no element appears more
   than once. We don't care about the order of elements, so we'll make it tail
   recursive and use '::'. *)

(* NAMES. Return a list of strings that represent the names in PROPOSITION. No
   string appears in the list more than once. The operator '@' appends two
   lists. We dispatch to code that gets the names from each connective. *)

let names proposition =

(* The big finish! *)

(* IS TAUTOLOGY. Test if PROPOSITION is a tautology. If PROPOSITION contains n
   distinct names, then this runs in O(2ⁿ) exponential time ☹. That means we
   should call it only on PROPOSITION's with small numbers of names. *)
